<h3 How I Became a Developer></h3>

After working in healthcare, I decided I was ready to make a shift into a new field. I wanted something that provided flexibility, an avenue for creativity and the ability to cultivate the lifestyle I dream of both for myself and my family. After talking with a friend that had gone through an accelerated software development program and was quickly working in the industry, I decided to make the switch. After a rigorous 20 weeks, I completed the Advanced Software Development with JavaScript certification through Code Fellows in April of 2023. I am now working on strengthening my skills as a developer, gaining confidence and learning all I can from those currently working within the tech field!
